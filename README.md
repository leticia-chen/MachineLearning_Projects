# Machine Learning Projects: Titanic
## Overview
### Titanic
This project is about learning evolution through the prediction of Titanic. It started with building algorithms for prediction using only pure Python code without using pandas/dataframe, and gradually incorporating panda/dataframe/scikit-learn into the algorithms. Later on, supervised learning and unsupervised learning models were used for prediction. The result of them was upload to Kaggle challenges.
