# Machine Learning Projects: Titanic and Boston Housing
## Overview
### Titanic
This project is about learning evolution through the prediction of Titanic. It started with building algorithms for prediction using only pure Python code without using pandas/dataframe, and gradually incorporating panda/dataframe/scikit-learn into the algorithms. Later on, supervised learning and unsupervised learning models were used for prediction. The result of them was upload to Kaggle challenges.
### Boston Housing
Boston Housing is a model that attempts to apply various machine learning algorithms for training, and then uploads the prediction results generated by the trained model to Kaggle challenges.
